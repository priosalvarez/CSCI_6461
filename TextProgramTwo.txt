The bird chirped into a light breeze which carried her song throughout Enchanted Forest. As each creature awoke to this tune they knew it was time and arose. Morning had come. Various scents filled the air while flowers opened up their pedals in hopes of absorbing some heat. Meanwhile clouds filled up above, pouring water atop everything. All living things scattered about, vanishing from sight. Maybe tomorrow will be better.
